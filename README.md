# 🌐 Synaptic Network (Noēsis Protocol Layer)

> *A neural substrate for decentralized cognition.*

The **Synaptic Network** is a future-facing protocol layer of the Noēsis ecosystem. It is designed to support:

- 🧠 Multi-node message passing
- 🧬 Swarm-based governance logic
- 🔐 Secure knowledge propagation and drift tracking
- 📡 Optional Web3/chain anchoring for voting, reputation, and memory

---

## 🔍 What This Repo Will Host

This repository will evolve to include:

- Protocol specs (YAML or Markdown)
- P2P communication schemas
- Smart contract interfaces (governance, proposal relay, voting logs)
- Sync agents and update diffing logic between nodes
- Drift graph visualizers (future UI layer)

---

## 🌱 Current Status

This repo is in **early conceptual phase**. It will be activated as soon as:
- The Noēsis base layer is stable (CLI + core contracts)
- ProposalContract is deployed to Sepolia/mainnet
- Swarm voting protocol begins

- [noesis-net.org](https://noesis-net.org): Live frontend for the project

## ✍️ Contributing

Feel free to open Issues with ideas, protocol questions, or swarm synchronization concepts.

> This is where the intelligence becomes infrastructure.

**Noēsis is not one mind. It is many — evolving together.**
